<p><strong>Freelancer Tax Tips on Accurate Income Reporting</strong></p>
<p>Reporting income accurately is one of the most critical freelancer tax tips. As a freelancer, every dollar earned—regardless of the source—must be declared to the IRS.

<p>To ensure accuracy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a running log of all client payments throughout the year.</li>
<li>Cross-check reported income against your bank deposits.</li>
<li>Reconcile 1099-NEC forms with your own records to catch discrepancies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using accounting software or apps can streamline this process, but ultimately, it’s your responsibility to ensure the figures you report are correct.</p>
