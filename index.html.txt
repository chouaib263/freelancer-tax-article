    <h1>Understanding Freelancer Taxes</h1>

    <p>As the freelance economy continues to grow, understanding the tax implications of self-employment is more crucial than ever. Freelancers, unlike traditional employees, are responsible for managing their own taxes, which can be complex and overwhelming.</p>

    <h2>What Taxes Do Freelancers Pay?</h2>
    <p>Freelancers are generally required to pay:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Income Tax</strong>: Based on your total earnings.</li>
      <li><strong>Self-Employment Tax</strong>: Covers Social Security and Medicare taxes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Keeping Track of Your Income</h2>
    <p>It’s essential to maintain accurate records of all payments received. Consider using accounting software or spreadsheets to track your income and expenses.</p>

    <h2>Deductible Expenses</h2>
    <p>Freelancers can often deduct the following expenses:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Home office expenses</li>
      <li>Software and tools</li>
      <li>Internet and phone bills (partial)</li>
      <li>Professional development courses</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Quarterly Estimated Taxes</h2>
    <p>Freelancers must usually pay estimated taxes four times a year. These payments cover both income and self-employment taxes.</p>

    <h2>Working with a Tax Professional</h2>
    <p>Consider consulting a tax advisor who specializes in self-employment to ensure you’re compliant and to help identify additional deductions.</p>
